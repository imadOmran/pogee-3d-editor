# Grids Plugin #

The Grids plugin is used to view/edit a zone's grid/waypoint data from the configured database.  Currently writing edited data to the database is not implemented however the query will be generated and be saved to a text file or viewed directly.

# Usage and Controls #

At any given time only one grid and the waypoints associated with that grid will be displayed.

**Controls**

**LMB** : Select waypoint

**LMB + LSHIFT**: Create new waypoint for selected grid

**LMB + LCTRL**: Set the currently selected waypoint's heading to point to the clicked location

**LMB + LALT**: Move the currently selected waypoint's location to the clicked location
